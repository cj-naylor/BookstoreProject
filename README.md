Hi, this is my Bookstore project! In this project I connect multiple classes together to perform the functionality of a bookstore. I incorporated a filescanner to create the inventory for said bookstore,
this reads off of the inventory.csv file and uses its information to create objects for the bookstores inventory. My bookstore uses a switch statement to give the customer multiple options of what to 
do once the program is activated, options such as "Make a Purchase" and "Register as a Member". There are many functionalities that I incorporated into this project, such as a restockProduct() method and an 
organizeProducts() method. After bookstore progam is ran, a txt file is created that serves as an End of Day Report. This shows us how many new members were registered, money spent in store, and products 
purchased for the day. Let me know if you have any questions!
